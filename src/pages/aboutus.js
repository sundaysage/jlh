          <p>
            Mr. Justin Lee huang was born in the vibrant city of Norwich,
            Norfolk, United Kingdom, into a richly multicultural family. His
            mother, originally from Miri Sarawak Malaysia and his father, a
            British Korean, instilled in him a deep appreciation for diverse
            cultures, values, and traditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This unique blend of Eastern and Western influences shaped his
            worldview, nurtured a respect for different perspectives, and laid
            the foundation for the global mindset he carries into his work
            today. From an early age, Justin demonstrated a natural curiosity
            for how things work and an exceptional aptitude for science and
            engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up in Norwich, he excelled in academics, balancing a strong
            work ethic with an eagerness to learn beyond the classroom. Science
            fairs, engineering clubs, and independent research projects were not
            just extracurricular activities — they were the beginnings of a
            lifelong passion for innovation in the energy sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the age of 18, Justin was accepted into the prestigious Imperial
            College London, one of the world’s leading universities for science
            and engineering. His academic journey focused on Petrochemical
            Engineering, a field that perfectly aligned with his interests in
            energy, industrial processes, and sustainable resource development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Driven by a desire to contribute to the advancement of energy
            technology, Justin pursued postgraduate studies, culminating in an
            Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Petrochemical Engineering. His
            doctoral research focused on advanced pipeline systems, crude oil
            extraction methods, and next-generation energy infrastructure —
            knowledge that would later become the backbone of his professional
            career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further cementing his professional standing, Justin earned the
            prestigious title Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in the United
            Kingdom — an honor that signifies both exceptional technical
            expertise and adherence to the highest ethical and professional
            standards in engineering practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            With his academic and professional credentials firmly established,
            Justin founded ML Global Energy Limited, building on a vision
            inspired in part by his late father’s entrepreneurial legacy. Under
            his leadership, the company has expanded its scope to include
            pipeline installation, crude oil drilling, gas exploration, nuclear
            and renewable energy projects, offshore rig infrastructure, and fuel
            depot operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Justin's leadership is defined by his commitment to innovation,
            sustainability, and global collaboration — values deeply rooted in
            both his upbringing and professional journey.
